This repository contains code for calculating, analyzing, and visualizing whale risk for RAIMBOW project

## File descriptions

### Analysis files (markdown files)
* Entanglements_timeseries.Rmd: Plot time series of CA DC confirmed, known-set-location entanglements.
* Entanglement_gridID.Rmd: Determine grid cell values, for report location and gear set county, for CA DC humpback entanglements with known gear set/time
* Whale_risk.Rmd: Calculates (humpback) whale risk of entanglement for each grid cell as: humpback density * fishing measure. This file then saves the humpback (density), fishing (total sum), and risk (density) values as an RDATA file for use in subsequent files.
* Whale_risk_timeseries.Rmd: Using RDATA file generated by Whale_risk.Rmd, summarizes and plots humpback whale risk of entanglement by region over time. Note that file has been updated to use 'long' data to make future adaptations/code adjustments easier
* Whale_risk_timeseries_base_line_local_rcr.R: A first look (i.e. region-calculated risk) at how risk would change if all humpback or fishing values were 'baseline' values, meaning the average of the values for the 2009-2010 to 2012-2013 fishing seasons.
* Whale_risk_maps.Rmd: Generates heat maps of data saved in Whale_risk.Rmd.

### Analysis files (other)
* JS_OceanVisions: Code used to create plots of Jameal's April 2019 OceanVisions presentation
* VMS_nonconfidential_duplicates.R: Identify duplicate rows in CA-only, non-confidential data
* Whale_risk_timeseries_orig.R: Original document for computing and summarizing time series of humpback risk of entanglement. This file used to be named 'Whale_risk_monthly_summ'.

### Helper files
* plot_raimbow.R: Functions for plotting objects (specifically maps); functions fairly specific to raimbow analyses
* User_script_local.R: Script for determining whom is running the code (user info used to set appropriate file paths); sourced in relevant files
* Whale_risk_timeseries_funcs.R: Helper plotting functions for Whale_risk_timeseries file(s)
* whalepreds_aggregate: Summarize whale predictions by specified time interval. Do not edit; any edits should be done in [the whale-model-prep repository](smwoodman/whale-model-prep) and copied over
